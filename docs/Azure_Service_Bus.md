# Azure Service Bus and Message Queue Basics

## Message Queue

- **Producer/Publisher**: Sends messages to the queue.
- **Queue**: Stores messages until processed.
- **Consumer/Subscriber**: Receives and processes messages from the queue.
- **Decoupling**: Producers and consumers interact with the queue, improving scalability and flexibility.

## Reliability and Scalability

- **Ensures messages are not lost** if the receiver is unavailable.
- **Allows scaling consumers** to handle high volumes of messages.

## Features

- **Dead-lettering**: Handles unprocessable messages.
- **Scheduled Delivery**: Schedule messages for specific times.
- **Message Deferral**: Defer message processing.

# Implementation Steps for Chat Application

## Set Up Azure Service Bus

1. Create namespace and queues for chat and file messages.

## Sending Messages

- **Text Messages**: Send to queue with TTL of 24 hours.
- **File Messages**: Upload to Blob Storage, send URL to queue with appropriate TTL.

## Receiving Messages

- **Text Messages**: Auto-expire after 24 hours unless flagged for retention.
- **File Messages**: Delete from Blob Storage upon closing the file URL.

## Message Handling

- **File Viewing**: Trigger deletion upon URL closing.
- **Text Retention**: Update TTL or move to retention queue if agreed by both users.

## Monitoring and Management

- Track message delivery, processing, and failures.
- Handle unprocessable messages with dead-lettering.

# Can Azure Service Bus Handle This?

- **TTL Support**: Automatically expire and delete messages.
- **URL Closure Trigger**: Process to handle file deletion upon URL closure.
- **Retention Flag**: Mechanism to update TTL for retained messages.

# Integration of Socket.io and Azure Service Bus

- **Socket.io**: Handles real-time bidirectional communication.
- **Azure Service Bus**: Manages reliable message queuing and decoupling.
- **Integration**: Use Socket.io for real-time chat and Azure Service Bus for reliable backend message handling.

# Example Scenario

- **Text Message**: Send to queue with 24-hour TTL. Auto-expire unless retained.
- **File Message**: Upload to Blob Storage, send URL to queue. Delete from storage upon URL closure.

# Conclusion

Azure Service Bus ensures reliable message handling with expiration and URL closure-based deletion, suitable for chat applications. Socket.io can be integrated with Azure Service Bus for real-time communication and reliable message queuing.

# Updated Implementation Plan for Chat Application with Azure Blob Storage, Azure Service Bus, and SAS URL

This plan outlines the components and their roles in a chat application that utilizes Azure Blob Storage for file uploads and Azure Service Bus for message queuing. The server-side logic is consolidated into a single file, `chat.socket.js`, which includes Socket.io configuration.

## File Structure

- **azureBlob.service.js**: Handles file uploads to Azure Blob Storage.
- **azureServiceBus.service.js**: Manages Azure Service Bus connections and message handling.
- **chat.jsx**: Frontend component for the chat interface using Socket.io.
- **chat.socket.js**: Server-side setup for Socket.io, including routes for file uploads and message handling.

## Component Responsibilities

### azureBlob.service.js

- **Role**: Handle file uploads to Azure Blob Storage.
- **Functions**:
  - `uploadFileToAzureBlob(fileBuffer, blobName)`: Uploads a file to Azure Blob Storage.
  - `deleteFileById(blobName)`: Deletes a file from Azure Blob Storage.

### azureServiceBus.service.js

- **Role**: Manage Azure Service Bus connections and message handling.
- **Functions**:
  - `sendMessageToQueue(queueName, message)`: Sends a message to the specified queue.
  - `receiveMessagesFromQueue(queueName)`: Receives messages from the specified queue.
  - `deleteMessageFromQueue(queueName, messageId)`: Deletes a specific message from the queue.
- **Setup**:
  - Establish connection with Azure Service Bus.
  - Define necessary queues for text and file messages.

### chat.jsx

- **Role**: Frontend chat interface using Socket.io for real-time communication.
- **Functions**:
  - Select file and get local path.
  - Request SAS URL from server via Socket.io.
  - Upload file using SAS URL.
  - Send and receive messages via Socket.io.
- **Workflow**:
  - User selects a file.
  - Request SAS URL from server.
  - Upload file to Azure Blob Storage using SAS URL.
  - Server returns the file URL, which is then sent to the receiver via Socket.io.

### chat.socket.js

- **Role**: Server-side configuration including Socket.io setup.
- **Functions**:
  - Setup and initialize Socket.io.
  - Define routes for file upload using `azureBlob.service.js`.
  - Handle real-time messaging using Socket.io.
  - Integrate Azure Service Bus for message queuing.
